# Shortest-Path-Algorithms

In this repository I have implemented 3 algorithms:
  1. Dijsktra's Algorithm
  2. Prim's Algorithm
  3. Krushkal's Algorithm

## Technologies used:
1. Operating Sysytem: Ubuntu
2. C/C++

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm finds a shortest path tree from a single source node, by building a set of nodes that have minimum distance from the source.

Disadvantage of the algorithm is the, that it does a blind search there by consuming a lot of time waste of necessary resources. Another disadvantage is that it cannot handle negative edges.

### Prim's Algorithm
Prim's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that takes a graph as input and finds the subset of the edges of that graph which forms a tree that includes every vertex and has the minimum sum of weights among all the trees that can be formed from the graph.
